## Problem Statement

Build a `Quotes API` using Node. <br>

- Query Parameters :
  - Number of Quotes : To return a specified number of quotes.
  - Category of Quotes :To return  quotes from the following categories.
    - Inspirational quotes.

- The `API` should return **`JSON`** data.
  - e.g <br>
  > {<br>
"quote" : "This is a quote",<br>
"category" : "Funny"<br>
}

#### Do's and Don'ts

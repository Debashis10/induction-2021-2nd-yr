# Backend Development using Node

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Problem Statement

Build a `Quotes API` using Node. <br>

- Endpoint should take minimum 2 number of **Query**.
- Query Parameters :
  - Number of Quotes.
  - Category of Quotes :
    - Inspirational quotes.
    - Funny quotes.
- The `API` should return **`JSON`** data.

#### Do's and Don'ts
- **Do** : You can use raw JSON data to populate your database. <br>
- **Don't** :  Don't use prebuild APIs to create endpoints or redirect your Server to the Third party APIs.

## Task Submission

1. Fork this repository and make a folder by your "Name" in the [Task Submission](./Task%20Submission) folder.
2. Inside your designated folder upload the source code of your Application and a `README` explaining briefly your Query Parameters along with the **link** where it is being hosted.
3. Create `Pull request` with the **link** in the description.

<b>- Index.php</b> takes two inputs i.e., number of quotes and the category of quote (funny or inspirational) which is sent as JSON data through cURL to get a response as JSON data from an external URL that is api.php.<br>
<b>-</b> The site is hosted at [Click Here](https://adyarath.in/) . To cross-check the api use the contents of index.php in your website or localhost :)
